# Xplore-SA-Website
A static website build with HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript. This was build as my first web development project for Xplore-SA, complete with a homepage, about, xplore, and a contact page. The travel site allows users to discover their favourite cities in South Africa, and learn more about what each of these cities has to offer.
